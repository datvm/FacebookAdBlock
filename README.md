This is the repository for the Chrome Extension Facebook AdBlocker as a small personal project for myself.

You can also side-load the extension from this repository.

The code is very simple, you can see how the ads are detected and hidden in the Javascript file. No tracking included.

If Facebook patches it, I may update the extension but no promise as this is just a personal project and I gain no profit from it.
